## Platform SDKs
In order to run your app on a device, you'll need **Platform SDKs** for the platforms and the versions you are developing for. If you just want to develop in the browser for now, no SDKs are needed. Head over to Cordova Documentation: [Platform Guides](http://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/latest/guide/platforms/index.html) or Cordova CLI: [Requirements](https://github.com/apache/cordova-cli/#requirements) for further instructions.
#### Note
You don't have to install the **Cordova CLI**. It's provided with the generator. We're installing the Cordova CLI locally (not globally) so you can use the one your project was built with rather than the one you have installed on your machine.
